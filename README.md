# virid

## [中文说明](README.zh.md)

`virid` is a deterministic, message-driven engine designed for heavy Electron applications, built with `TypeScript`. It completely decouples business logic from the clutter of UI frameworks, establishing a micro-distributed core with location transparency.

This repository is the `Python` port of `virid` (**Work in Progress**), aimed at providing strong determinism, synchronization, and decoupled state management and control tools for chaotic Python control flows.
